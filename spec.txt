Spec:
 
Attached is a mockup of a gallery page for a website. I have drawn a red box around the area of the image we would like to see marked up in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
 
•	The gallery should be adaptable and responsive.
o	There is an index of 10 thumbnails showing the gallery’s images running across the top of the current selected photo. The gallery should not be limited to just 10 images/slides, i.e. there could be 5 more thumbnails not visible in this mockup.
•	The amount of text / paragraphs below the photo is not limited to just the number shown.
•	The index of thumbnails should be removed on mobile view.
•	The text beneath the photo is related to the photo itself, therefore should update as the user clicks through the gallery.
•	JavaScript frameworks and plugins can be used – we’ll be looking at the choice and integration in this instance.
•	Flourish is fine.
